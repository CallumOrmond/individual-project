              The goal of the algorithm is to match two groups of people into pairs, where each agent has an ordered preference of 
              the agents within the other group. This is done with the Extended Gale-Shapley Algorithm, where a stable matching 
              is guaranteed.

            <p>
              The set up for this Algorithm is 2 equal groups of people that is <strong>n</strong> long, 
              in this case - men and woman.

            <h2>How it Works</h2>
              <p>
                To produce a stable matching, the algorithm works using the code to the left. Each agent 
                has the following properties. 
              </p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Preference Ranking - </strong>this is a list that orders the other group of people from most preferable to least preferable.</li>
                  <li><strong>Current Matching - </strong>this is the agent in the other group that they are proposed to.</li>
                </ul>
              

              <p>
                The algorithm works by selecting a man that is not matched with anyone, the man
                proposes to their highest-ranked women, if that woman is free or the man is more preferable
                to their current matching, then they are matched, and the man the woman was previously
                matched with is set to be free (not matched). This is repeated until all men and women are matched.
              </p>

              <p>
                In this version, it is biased towards the men and is known as man-orientated, and the produced
                matching is known as the man-optimal matching, this version is shown in code. To
                reverse this and create the woman-optimal matching, then the positions are simply switched 
                and the woman will be the one doing the proposing.

              <p>
                To produce a stable matching, the algorithm works using the code to the left, which is split into 2 phases. 
                Each agent also has the following properties. 
              </p>

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Preference Ranking - </strong>this is a list that orders the other people from most preferable to least preferable.</li>
                  <li><strong>Current Matching - </strong>this is the agent that they are proposed to.</li>
                </ul>

              <h3>Phase 1</h3>
                <p> 
                  Phase 1 is lines 1 - 10 in the code to the left. This phase is a version of Extended Gale-Shapley for 1 group.
                  A free agent <strong>p</strong> is provisionally assigned to the highest ranked person on their preference list  
                  <strong>b</strong>, if someone else was assigned to <strong>b</strong> then remove this assignment. Then the Delete
                  Function is called on <strong>b</strong> and each person less preferred than <strong>p</strong> on their preference list.
                </p>

              <h3>Phase 2</h3>
                <p>
                  Phase 2 is lines 11 - 19. This phase <strong>rotations</strong> are removed. while some preference rankings have more than
                  one ranking remaining, find a rotation in the preference rankings, and call the delete function on the pairs within the rotation.
                  If at any point a preference list is empty, then there is no stable matching. If each ranking only has 1 agent remaining this
                  is the stable matching.
                </p>

              <h4><strong>Delete Function</strong></h4>
                <p>
                  This takes a 2 people and removes each person from the other person's preference list.
                </p>
              
              <h4><strong>Rotations</strong></h4>
                <p>           
                  Simply rotations are cycles of ordered pairs. However, in practice this can be a bit tricky. but it can be done by following 
                  the steps below:
                </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>1 - Start with an agent who has more than one preference left, A, and set not them as the original O.</li>
                    <li>2 - Now set S to agent A's second most preferred agent.</li>
                    <li>3 - Now set L to S's least preferred agent</li>
                    <li>4 - Finally set A to L and add the pair (L, S) to the rotation list</li>
                    <li>5 - Repeat step 2 onwards until S is the same agent as we started with, O</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    Once this is done, we are left with a list of pairs, whereas mentions above these pairs are passed to the delete function where 
                    they are removed from each other's preference list.
                  </p>

                
              <p>
                In this version, there is only one group of people and thus no biases.

              <ul>
                <li><strong>Current Matching - </strong>this is the student(s) that are currently matched with the project .</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity - </strong>This is the maximum number of students that can be assigned to this project.</li>
              </ul>
                
              <h4><strong>Start</strong></h4>
              <p>
                The algorithm works by initially setting all agents to be free and unmatched. It then selects a student <strong>s</strong>, that is 
                free and has a non-empty preference ranking. Next <strong>p</strong> is set to <strong>s</strong>'s most preferred project and <strong>l</strong>
                is set to the lecturer that runs that project. Then <strong>s</strong> and <strong>p</strong> are provisionally assigned to each other. After this, 
                3 more checks are done:
              </p>

              <h4>1: Check for Over-Subscriptions</h4>
              <p>
                If <strong>p</strong> is over-subscribed, then the worst ranked student according to the lecturer that runs the project is unassigned 
                from the project.
                <br>
                Else If <strong>l</strong> is over-subscribed, then the worst student ranked by <strong>l</strong> that is assigned to a project that <strong>l</strong>
                runs, is unassigned from their project. 
              </p>

              <h4>2: Check If The Project is Full</h4>
              <p>
                If <strong>p</strong> is at capacity, then <strong>Sw</strong> is set to the worst student assigned to <strong>p</strong> according to the 
                lecturer that runs it. Then for each student <strong>Si</strong> that is ranked worse than <strong>Sw</strong> on the lecturers
                ranking and also finds <strong>p</strong> an acceptable project is found, then the delete function is called with the pair (<strong>Si, p</strong>).
              </p>


              <h4>3: Check If The Lecturer is Full</h4>
              <p>   
                If <strong>l</strong> is at capacity, then <strong>Sw</strong> is set to the worst student assigned to <strong>p</strong> according to the 
                lecturer that runs it. Then for each student <strong>Si</strong> that is ranked worse than <strong>Sw</strong> on the lecturers
                ranking, the delete function is called with the pair (<strong>Si, pi</strong>), where <strong>pi</strong> is all the projects that <strong>l</strong>
                offers, and that <strong>Si</strong> finds acceptable.
              </p>
              
              <p>   
                This then goes back to the start and is repeated until all students have a match, and a stable matching is found.
              </p>


              <h4><strong>Delete Function</strong></h4>
              <p>
                This takes a student and a project, then it removes the project from the student's <strong>Preference Ranking</strong>.
                Since projects don't have a preference ranking then the opposite operation is not required.
              </p>

              <p> 
                In this version, it is biased towards the students and is known as student-orientated, and the produced
                matching is known as the student-optimal matching, this version is shown in code. There also exists a lecturer-oriented
                version.
