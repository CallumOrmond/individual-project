                    <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px; font-weight: 300;">As this is a university project, there's a limit on what I can feasibly do in the time given, especially alongside the rest of my studies. However, below is a list of features, fixes and improvements I would love to make, if I had the time:</p>
                    <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 30px; font-weight: 300;">
                        <li>Implementation of more algorithms</li>
                        <li>Functionality to edit the capacities for hospitals and agents in SPA through edit preferences</li>                    
                        <li>A more in-depth, high quality tutorial</li>
                        <li>Option to easily change the orientation of each algorithm</li>
                        <li>Support ties within each algorithm</li>
                        <li>Screen responsiveness (app responding properly to different screen sizes)</li>
                        <li>Mobile version of the web app</li>
                        <li>More polish - ensuring no bugs and other oddities with presentation</li>
                        <li>User friendly system to create their own algorithms - possibly "writing code" or combining blocks of logic to create matching algorithms?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p style="font-size: 20px; line-height: 30px; font-weight: 300;">If there's anything you think would be a great addition to this app, please go through my evaluation and add your thoughts!</p>
